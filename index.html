        <h1>Where is the content?</h1>
        
        <p>You came here to see my work. And it is not here.</p>

        <p>
            The content is on its way. I tried an experiement to create a site using markdown and GRAV a flat file CMS. This was a fun expirement as I discovered, markdown and css grid together have limitations.
        </p>
        <p>
            The markdown is converted to a properly organize document outline and semantic HTML which is great. You can also intersperse inline tags such as spans. I feel treating spans like block level element is cheating.
        </p>

            Take a look at my <a href="assets/files/matthew_trefz_resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>. My phone number and email are include. I am happy to set up a quick conversation to show you my work, until I can post it here.
